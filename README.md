# Quick-React-Dev
Ready-to-go, out-of-the-box, barebones React starter kit featuring React 16, Webpack 4, and Babel. Perfect for hackathons or new fullstack projects.

# Getting started

Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/Chronobreak/Quick-React-Dev.git`

Navigate to the new folder `cd Quick-React-Dev`

Install dependencies `npm install`

Open a new tab and run Webpack `npm run webpack`

Open a new tab and run nodemon `npm run server`

Navigate to localhost:3000.

Webpack is watching your files for any changes. Nodemon will detect any changes and re-launch your server (no more shutting down the server and restarting manually).

# Easy peasy!
